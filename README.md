# Analyzing Stock Prices

I am a ML/DS novice, so I am using pre-existing tutorials then adjusting this code to suit my data needs. I am looking forward to learning more about finance and technology.
I am primarily interested in renewable energy, sustainable tech, and EVs, which is why I have looked at NIO and PLL so far!
